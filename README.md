ABOUT
This plugin is a web page that sends messages to the chat of YouTube or Twitch using MixItUpApp with a localhost API.

Received messages are used as keywords for commands and other Twitch tools.

Example: If a message like "donation 1 Rose" is sent, it will appear as "Rose" in the chat. You can configure a sound to play whenever "Rose" is mentioned or heard.

Additionally, with TwitchSpawn, you can create commands, messages, and various interactive events for Minecraft.

SongRequest allows you to queue up music requests, which can be played using Nightbot or Streamlabs. Check out tutorials for perfect functionality.
