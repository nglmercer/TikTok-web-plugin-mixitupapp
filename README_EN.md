## ABOUT

This plugin is a web page that sends messages to the YouTube or Twitch chat using MixItUpApp with a localhost API.

The received messages are used as keywords for commands and other Twitch tools.

Example: If a message like "donación 1 Rose" is sent, it will appear as "Rose" in the chat. You can configure a sound to play whenever "Rose" is mentioned or heard.

Furthermore, with TwitchSpawn, you can create commands, messages, and various interactive events for Minecraft.

SongRequest allows you to queue music requests, which can be played using Nightbot or Streamlabs. Refer to tutorials for seamless operation.
